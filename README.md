# Online-Shopping-Api

## Description

Online-Shopping-Api is a Rest API, that I am using to expand my knowledge of Rest API's, currently it has basic CRUD functionality.

## Documentation

Additional Information on how to run the app can be found in the Docs, directory.

## Packages at play

[MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR), Provides an extremely easy way to implement the CQRS Pattern.

[FluentValidation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation), Ties in extremely nicely with MediatR to validate Objects.

[Testcontainers](https://github.com/isen-ng/testcontainers-dotnet), Allows you to spin up an test instance of a container that you might need, in my case it was an MsSqlContainer.

## Running the tests

You should be able to run all the tests in the solution and they should be recognised by visual studio.
